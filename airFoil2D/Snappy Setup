Need to have '0' 'constant' 'system' folders  

'0' requires the files, all filled out and correct for the case,
- 'p'
- 'U'
- 'nut'

0 sets the boundary conditions with, p = pressure, U = initiall velocity, nut = wall function

'constant' requires the files, all filled out and correct for the case, 
- 'transportProperties' 
- 'turbulenceProperties'
- 'triSurface' folder with geometry .stl files 

transportProperties - sets a value for nu - kinematic viscosity
turbulenceProperties - sets the turbulence model for simulation
triSurface - a folder that is used to create the mesh around the geometry

'system' requires the files, all filled out and correct for the case,
- 'blockMeshDict'
- 'controlDict'
- 'fvSchemes'
- 'fvSolution'

- blockMeshDict - controls blockmesh utility, define the verticies of the rectange to mesh inside, define front and back faces using 
numbered verticies (0123) can be front (4567) can be back. 
- controlDict - sets input parameters that are essential for runnig the simulation, Time steps, when to start, stop and save etc
- fvSchemes - (Numerical Schemes) defines the treatment of each term in the equations, allows control of temporal, gradient, divergence and intetpolation
schemes. 
- fvSolution - (Solution methods) solution parameters and overall control of solution.


AFTER ALL IS SET UP AND CHECKED, 

WSL commands, 
- blockMesh              --- Initial Meshing, Sets the fluid domian and is controlled by 'blockMeshDict'
- sufaceFeatureExtract   --- Extracts the edge mesh (.emesh), the mesh is refined across the edges, controlled by castellatedMeshControls sub-dictionary 
                             in snappyHexMeshDict. 
- snappyHexMesh          --- The mesh generation, creates a mesh either in or outside your geometry (controlled by where you select to start the mesh) 
- simpleFoam             --- The actual solving of the Governing equations across your mesh, uses the SIMPLE algorithm and is controlled by fvSchemes and
                             fvSolution.
